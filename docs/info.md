## How it works

A T flip-flop, also known as a toggle flip-flop, is a type of sequential logic circuit that changes its output state (toggles) when triggered by a clock pulse and its input, labeled "tin", is high (1). If the "tin" input is low (0), the flip-flop holds its previous output state. Essentially, it acts as a controlled switch that toggles its output on and off based on the "tin" input and clock signal. 

## How to test

Refer to the state table of t flip flop. Observe if the output is correctly changing based on the input and clock pulse.
